# LaunchPad - Official Strapi Demo

![LaunchPad](./LaunchPad.jpg)

Welcome aboard **LaunchPad**, the official Strapi demo application, where we launch your content into the stratosphere at the speed of _"we-can't-even-measure-it!"_.
This repository contains the following:

- A Strapi project with content-types and data already onboard
- A Next.js client that's primed and ready to fetch the content from Strapi faster than you can say "blast off!"

## 🌌 Get started

Strap yourself in! You can get started with this project on your local machine by following the instructions below, or you can [request a private instance on our website](https://strapi.io/demo)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **Yarn** as your package manager (this project uses Yarn internally for its scripts)

> **Don't have Yarn installed?** You can enable it via Node.js Corepack:
> ```sh
> corepack enable
> ```
> Or install it globally via npm:
> ```sh
> npm install -g yarn
> ```

## 1. Clone and Install

To infinity and beyond! Clone the repo and install root dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/strapi/launchpad.git
cd launchpad
yarn install
```

## 2. Setup

Run the setup script to install dependencies in both projects (Strapi and Next.js) and copy the environment files:

```sh
yarn setup
```

## 3. Seed the Data

Populate your Strapi instance with demo content:

```sh
yarn seed
```

## 4. Start the Development Servers

Launch both Strapi and Next.js concurrently from the root:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts the Strapi server first, waits for it to be ready, then starts the Next.js frontend. You're now a spacefaring content master!

Visit http://localhost:1337/admin to create your first Strapi user, and http://localhost:3000 to discover your space rocket website.

## Customization

- The Strapi application contains a custom population middlewares in every api route.

- The Strapi application contains a postinstall script that will regenerate an uuid for the project in order to get some anonymous usage information concerning this demo. You can disable it by removing the uuid inside the `./strapi/packages.json` file.

- The Strapi application contains a patch for the @strapi/admin package. It is only necessary for the hosted demos since we automatically create the Super Admin users for them when they request this demo on our website.
